ðŸ”¥ BlazeWatch â€“ AI-Powered Wildfire Risk Prediction
BlazeWatch is an AI-driven web tool that predicts wildfire risk and visualizes it on an interactive map, helping communities and responders stay ahead of potential fires.

ðŸš€ Features
âœ… Predicts wildfire risk based on weather, vegetation, and historical data

âœ… Visual heatmap overlay (green = low risk, red = high risk)

âœ… Clickable map points with risk details

âœ… Fast, simple, accessible

ðŸ§  How It Works
Backend: Trained ML model (e.g. Random Forest) predicts fire risk scores (0â€“1) for grid coordinates.

Frontend: Interactive Leaflet.js map displays risk zones as color-coded markers.

Data: Uses open weather & satellite data (e.g. NASA FIRMS, NOAA).

âš¡ Tech Stack
Python (Scikit-learn or XGBoost)

Flask (API)

Leaflet.js (Map)

HTML/CSS/JS (Frontend)
