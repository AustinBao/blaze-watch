## Features
- **AI-Powered Risk Prediction**
Predicts wildfire spread based on weather, satellite, and historical data
- **Interactive Heatmap**
Visual heatmap overlay (green = low risk, red = high risk)
- **Detailed Information**
Clickable map points with risk details
- **User-Friendly**
Fast, simple, and accessible interface

## Process Overview

### Backend

#### Training the Machine Learning Model
- Uses **satellite and weather data** to train a fire spread predictor
- Fire boundaries are represented by **max/min lat/lon points** (N/E/S/W edges)
- For each fire on a given day, the model predicts the **next-day edge coordinates**
- Uses **XGBoost Regressor** within a multi-output regression setup
- Predicts **8 coordinate values** representing 4 directional edge points

#### Model Evaluation
- Uses **Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)** in degrees of latitude/longitude
- **Cross-validation** used to reduce overfitting and improve accuracy

### Frontend
- Interactive Leaflet.js map displays risk zones as color-coded markers
- Responsive web interface
